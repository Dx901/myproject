## Project About
In this project I create a productivity timer to maximize productivity

## Introduction
Most of the time time management is something most students struggle with
Different people have different concenetration spans but with this timer concenetration should not be an issue since the work is divided in to small portions

## How it works

The working hours have been divided into 25 minutes
The rest period is assigned 5 minutes
There is also a longer rest period of 15 minutes which comes up after you have been working for four sessions
When you hit the start button, the countdown starts to count and continues even after you exit the tab
When the working tie elapses, a notification is sent to notify the start of your five minute break
Also when the break time is up, a notification is sent to inform you to get back to work
You may pause in between the timer sessions to switch up the hit start to continue



## Requirements

You must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed on your machine. This project was
built against the following versions:

Node v18.6.0
npm v8.13.2

## OBJECTIVES

Timer start counting when you hit start
Timer to stop when you hit stop
A notification to be sent when one session is over
The timers to simultaneously start when one session ends
The long break session to start after four working sessions
